# Simple Drag and Drop 

A simple drag-and-drop UI built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript (part of a Weekly Code Challenge to keep skills sharp after graduation from General Assembly)

Functionality:
- Drag any small box into a large box
- Drag any small box onto any other small box to swap their positions
- Hit the "Shuffle!" button to shuffle the small boxes within each large box
- Hit the "Reset!" button to return everything to its original position
